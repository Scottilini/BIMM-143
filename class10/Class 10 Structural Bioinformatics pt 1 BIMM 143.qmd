## The PDB Database

Here we examine the size and compostion of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB. 

Get a CSV file from the PDB databse and read it into R.
```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)

```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
x <- "2.22"
as.numeric(x) +1
```
WE are going to use a function called `gsub()` which stands for global substitution. This is going to replace all the commas with an empty space in the list.
```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdbstats$X.ray))
```

I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in the table.

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}
commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```
Now let's try to *APPLY* this to all of the columns.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
totals
```
Now to answer the question:  From the table below, the answer is 8.72 is solved by EM.
```{r}
round((totals / totals["Total"]) * 100,2)
```



>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(commasum(pdbstats[1,7])/ totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```


>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

**PROF SAID** we are going to skip this question.


# 2. Viualizing Protein Strucutre 


We will learn the basics of Mol* (mol-star). https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with PDB code 1HSG

This is general photo of the structure
![](1HSG.png)

Show the ASP 25 Amino acids: 
These are really important so I highlighted them in green!

## Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamic (flexibility) of an important protein:

(We are jumping down to 3 (predicting dynamics))

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
This the first atoms of the 1HSG protein! We saw this same file in the PDB website!
```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will doa Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
library("bio3d")
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:
```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol*
